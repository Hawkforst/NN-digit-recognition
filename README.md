# NN-digit-recognition
Basic Neural Network with one hidden layer 

Simple implementation on a neural network on a handwritten digit dataset from Kaggle. (Dataset somewhat reduced to fit into 25 MB limit for github web interface)

Forward and Backprop equation derivation "borrowed" from https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-neural-network-with-a-single-hidden-layer-using-numpy-923be1180dbfhttps://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-neural-network-with-a-single-hidden-layer-using-numpy-923be1180dbf
